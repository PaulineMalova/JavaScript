NUMBER ONE
Assume I have this object:

let myFruits = {
  
orange: 10,

  apple: 30,

  passion: 50,

  grapes: 100,

  banana: 10,

}


How can I print a list of fruits and with their prices? e.g.
orange => KES 10
apple => KES 30 (edited) 

function printFruits() {
	let myFruits = {
  		orange: 10,
  		apple: 30,
  		passion: 50,
  		grapes: 100,
  		banana: 10,
	}
	for (fruit in myFruits) {
		if (myFruits.hasOwnProperty(fruit)) { 
			console.log (fruit + " => KES" + myFruits[fruit]);
       		}
    	}
}
