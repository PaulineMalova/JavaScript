DECLARATION, INITIALIZATION AND DEFINITION IN JAVA SCRIPT
Declaration
Giving a variable a name using the key word ‘var’.
	Examples: var blinknumber;
		  var message;
		       var percentage;
One can also declare multiple variable with the same var keyword.
	Example: var blinknumber, message;
One should not re-declare the same variable twice.

Initialization
When you declare a variable, it is automatically given an initial value, which is 'undefined'.
	Example: var blinknumber;   - its already initialized to 'undefined' value.

Definition of a variable
Storing a value in a declared variable. The value could be of type string, integer or float.
There are 2 ways of definition:
      •	Defining at the time of creation of the variable.
	Example: var blinknumber = 10;
	     var message = “Hello World!”;
	     var blinknumber, message = 10, “Hello World!”;
	     var percentage = 50.0%;
      •	Declaring a variable then defining it later when one needs to use it.
	Example: var percentage;
	         percentage = 50.0%;
	
Definition of a function
Naming a function and specifying what to do when the function is called.
It consists of the function keyword, the name of the function, a list of parameters to the function separated by commas and the code to be executed on the function placed inside curly brackets.
Functions are named using the camelCase notation.
It can be done in 2 ways:
      •	Function declaration
        Example: function name(parameter1, parameter 2, parameter 3) {
                 // code to be executed
                 }

                 function dopeStuff(a,b,c) {
                 return a + b + c;
                 }

      •	Function expression
        This is whereby a function is defined and stored inside a variable thus it does not necessarily need a name. This is called an anonymous function.
	       Example:  var x = function (a,b,c) {return a + b + c};
        However, a function name can also be given in some cases if one wants to refer to the function within the function.
	       Example: var x = function dopeStuff(a) {return a>1? a : a * dopeStuff(a+1); };
