-Java Script allows one to do some front-end programming in that it changes the behavior of the web pages created in HTML and CSS and also their appearance. 
-It can also be used to code the back-end using the Node-JS library.

-One can see the output of code using the 'console.log' command, which enables the printing of the output on the console.
 -Java Script is run on the browser.
 An example is:      console.log("Hello, World!");     
	              console.log("Java Script is a very functional and marketable programming language.");
