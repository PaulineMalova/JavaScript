1). The IF statement
    -Allows one to check whether the given expression is true or false.
    -The expression is executed differently depending on whether it is true or false.
 	example:    if (a>=2){
		    console.log(a);
		  }
		  else{
		     console.log("It's less than required.");
		  }
    **Strict equals/comparison - checks whether both the value and type of a variable are the same.
    **Loose equals/comparison - checks whether the value of variables is the same; but not the type.
	examples:       1 == "1"            //true
		        1 === "1"        //false

    *Inequality expressions can be used to evaluate expressions. They include:
	> - Greater than.	>= - Greater than or equal to.	             == - Loosely equal to.
	< - Less than.	<= - Less than or equal to.	             === - Strictly equal to.
	!= - Not equal to.
    
    *Logical operators are also useful in evaluation of expressions.
	&& - AND operator - checks if both expressions are true.
	|  | - OR operator - checks if at least one of the expressions is true.
	! - NOT operator

2).The SWITCH statement
    -It can be used in place of the if statement.
	example: 
		switch(a) {
		    case 80:
		            return "A";
		            break;
		    case 70:
		    case 60:
		             return "C";
		             break;
		    default:
		             return "F";
		             break;
		}
	
	** The 'default' corresponds with the 'else' statement while using the if statement.
	**The 'break' statement is used to prevent the next code block from being executed before its rightful turn.
	**Absence of the 'break' statement leads to fall-through.
