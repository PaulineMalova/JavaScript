1). Addition operator (+)
    -Used for adding numbers.
	example: 1+2	            //3
		var d = 3;
		var f = 50;
		var h = d + f;           //h=53
    -Also used for concatenation of strings, either with other strings or numbers.
	example: "Cats are" + 2 + "times stubborn."       //Cats are 2 times stubborn.

2). Subtraction (-)

4). Multiplication (*)
    -Used to get the product of numbers.
	example:     30*15              //450

5). Modulus (%)
    -Used to get the remainder of a division operation.
	example:      20%6             //2

There are also combined assignment and operation operators:
	examples:     /=
		     *=
		     -=
		     +=
		     %=

Java Script also has a Math module that contains more advanced functions:
	examples:    Math.abs - calculates the absolute value of a number.
		    Math.exp - calculates e to the power of a number.
		    Math.pow(x,y) - calculates the result of x to the power of y.
		    Math.floor - removes the fraction part from a number.
		    Math.random() - gives a random number x where 0<=x<1
