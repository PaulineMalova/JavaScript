Arrays - they are used to hold a range of variables.
Arrays function like a list, stack or queue.
Arrays are defined in 2 ways:
	a) Bracket notation 
	     example: var fruitslist = ["apples","mangoes","oranges"];
	b) Array object notation
	     example: var fruitslist = new Array("apples","mangoes","guavas");
Indices are used to access the values stored in an array according to their positions.
The first number is at index 0, the second at one and so on.
For instance, in the fruitslist declared above:
	fruitslist[0] = "apples";
	fruitslist[2] = "oranges";
Arrays in Java Script are sparse, in that one can asign values to random locations in the array, regardless of whether or not the previous positions are occupied.
For instance:
	fruitslist[6] = "pawpaws";
	fruitslist = ["apples","mangoes","oranges",undefined,undefined,undefined,"pawpaws"]
Different types of elements can be stored in a single array.
For example: 
	var random = ["books", 34, {"marks":80},[1,2,3,4]];
